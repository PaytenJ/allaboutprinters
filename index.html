        <p class="soper"><strong>Directions</strong><br><br>Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan, then turn off the heat and poor in the large package of lime jello mix and use a whisk to stir it until everything is blended. Stir in the 7-Up/ Srite. Stir in the pudding mix. Stir in the cornstarch, the powdered sugar, the whipped cream, and then the small jello package. Whisk everything around so it's blended smoothly and there aren't any lumps. Add food colouring as desired.** Pour as much filling as you can into the cooled pie shells. Just make sure you can carry them to your fridge without spilling. Refrigerate your pie for a 2-3 hours or so until the filling sets.

            <li class="puffs">Time: 55 minutes</li>
            <li class="puffs">Serves: 20 people</li>
        </ul>
        
     
        
        <p class="puffs"><strong>Directions</strong><br><br>Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C*)
In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Centers should be dry.
When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.
