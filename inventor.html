<h2>Chester Carlson</h2>
       
 
        <p> Chester Carlson was the first inventor of the computer printer. The name he had called his printer was Xerox,<br>
       which was invented in 1938. Chester was an American citizen born in February 8, 1906 in Seattle, Washington, United States<br>
       and died on September 19, 1968 in New York City, New York, United States of America. The reason he had created this amazing invention<br>
       was because while in collague he needed to take notes in one of the law textbooks he could not afford and wanted to find a way to make<br> 
       duplicates of the same document.<br>
