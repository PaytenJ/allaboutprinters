        <p class="puffs">Though it is unknown how the original printers worked <br>
                the laser printer can be fully described here on how it operates. They are actually extremely similar to the photocopiers<br>
                with a minor differents. Ink particles transfer from a laser which is guided by the computer, it then 'fuses' to the<br>
                paper. This is done by a roler inside the printer to make sure the ink is completley transfered onto the paper.

        <p class= "Ireland-Info"> Chester Carlson was the first inventor of the computer printer. The name he had called his printer was Xerox,<br>
       which was invented in 1938. Chester was an American citizen born in 	February 8, 1906 in Seattle, Washington, United States<br>
       and died on September 19, 1968 in New York City, New York, United States of America. The reason he had created this amazing invention<br>
       was because while in collague he needed to take notes in one of the law textbooks he could not afford and wanted to find a way to make<br> 
       duplicates of the same document.<br>
